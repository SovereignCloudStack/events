# Sovereign Cloud Stack - not yet another cloud stack

## Submission Abstract (~ 500 characters):

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is built upon the shoulders of giants: With proven technology such
as OpenStack and Kubernetes the SCS project is building a modular software stack. SCS is much more
than just another cloud stack - much rather SCS defines standards as part of a community process in
which CSPs work together on their use-cases while also providing a reference implementation.
The first third of the talk is a general overview of the project, the greater part will dive into 
the technical architecture of the SCS stack.
