# Standardization in the SCS community

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project started with the observation that the
fragmentation between the fully open source alternatives to build cloud/
container stacks is seriously hurting its usefulness and adoption.

To address this, the SCS project works with a growing community of
infrastructure providers to jointly overcome this. Together we define standards
to ensure seamless interoperability for workloads that live on top of SCS
standards-compliant infrastructure. Obviously these standards are based on top
of existing upstream standards, such as the OpenStack Powered Guidelines or the
CNCF conformance tests, but go beyond it where divergence hurts the easy
portability of workloads.

The project also creates a modular, fully open source reference implementation
which conforms to the standards and which can be used by providers in parts or
in full. Using many common parts obviously saves a lot of work for green-field
approaches, but providers of existing platforms may take a much more gradual
approach.

Operating complex distributed platforms such as cloud- and container stack
is and remains a challenge for the Operators. The SCS community invests to
make it easier. Sharing knowledge and working together on operational topics
are important goals for the new Open Operations movement that has emerged
out of these efforts.

The presentation will focus on the standardization efforts.
It will give a view on how the standards are structured, how they are validated
and how the resulting certification levels will look like. It describes what
has been achieved already and more importantly how the process works to establish
agreement of further standards. There is a substantial list of things ahead ...
