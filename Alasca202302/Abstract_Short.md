# Standardization in the SCS community

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project is a growing network of providers that
collaborate to build common standards, a modular, open reference implementation
and also have started to share best practices and work together on operational
topics as part of the open operations movement.

While existing providers may take a gradual approach in adopting and benefitting
from the joint reference implementation, the standards and also the shared
operational practices can be defined and adopted by new and existing providers
alike.

The presentation will cover the standardization efforts -- how they are
structured and validated and how a resulting certification program looks like.
It describe what has been achieved already and how agreement is built, documented
and validated working on the substantial list of things ahead.
