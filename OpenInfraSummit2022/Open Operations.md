# An Open Operations concept

Track: Open Development

Authors: Kurt Garloff

## Abstract (1000 chars)

The Open Infrastructure technologies have become increasingly mature over the
last years. Nevertheless, the management and operations of platforms at high
quality continues to require DevOps teams with significant skills. The
Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project has been created with the goal to
significantly lower the bar.

While the integration of a standardized operational stack helps the
platform operations teams, it is only an important first step towards
the goal.

The next step is to create strong communities that share operational practices
and make them openly available. Documenting best practices, publishing the little
tools to do cleanup jobs or the setup of dashboards that can be used for capacity
management are all important contributions.

Being transparent about bugs, incidents, security reponses may sound disturbing
to traditional Ops teams at first -- yet it is a key to build up experience. It also
helps to create trust with users, especially when incidents do occur.

This is the essence of what we call Open Operations.

## What should attendees expect to learn? (1000 chars)

Attendees learn 

* Why Open Operatons matters
* What it means
* How it works
* How Operators can be motivated to participate

The SCS project goes beyond existing efforts in a number of ways.
It networks existing platform DevOps teams to jointly standardize and
integrate numerous Open Source projects including Open Stack services,
ID federation capabilities, operational tools, k8s and k8s services
and in this way create an opinionated best-of-practice full stack
following the 4 opens of successful OIF projects.

In some way it's an extension of the Open Source idea from development
to operations -- we thus call it Open Operations.
