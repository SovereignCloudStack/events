# An Open Operations concept

Track: Open Development

Authors: Kurt Garloff

## Abstract (1000 chars)

The Open Source technologies for managing open infrastructure have become
increasingly mature over the last years. Nevertheless, the management and
operations of significant platforms at high quality continues to require
significant skills and the author has observed teams struggling with these
tasks. The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project has been created with the goal
to significantly lower the bar to be successful with Open Source Infrastructure
operation.

The SCS project goes beyond existing efforts in a number of ways.
It networks existing platform DevOps teams to jointly standardize and
integrate numerous Open Source projects including Open Stack services,
ID federation capabilities, operational tools, k8s and k8s services
and in this way create an opinionated best-of-practice full stack
following the 4 opens of successful OIF projects.

While the integration of a standardized operational stack helps the
platform operations teams, it does only cover a few steps on the way
to make operations easier.

The next step is to create strong communities that share operational
practices and make it openly available. It makes best practices
available as well as the little jobs that Ops teams create to do
cleanup jobs or the setup of dashboards that can be used for
capacity management. Going a step further, Ops teams can work together
and be transparent about issues -- bugs, incidents, security response
are all important practices that require experience. Sharing it allows
such experience to be built up much faster and also provide a transparency
towards users that give them insight and trust into the platform operations
practices.

In some way it's an extension of the Open Source ideas from development
to operations -- we thus call it Open Operations, combining the skills
and practices for an Open DevOps approach.
