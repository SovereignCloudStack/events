# Collaboration over Competition - Fostering a community of CSPs

## Abstract (1000 chars)

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is built upon the shoulders of giants: With proven technology such
as OpenStack and Kubernetes the SCS project is building a modular software stack. SCS is much more
than just another cloud stack - much rather SCS defines standards as part of a community process in
which CSPs work together on their use-cases while also providing a reference implementation.
Following the foundation the SCS builds upon the four opens are part of the core dna of the project - 
however this is extended by a fifth pillar: Open Operations. The CSPs that engage in the community
bring in their experiences, expertise and exchange not only solutions but also problems and hurdles
that are faced in day to day operations of cloud platforms.

## What should attendees expect to learn? (1000 chars)

Often companies view each other as competitors and barriers exists to share failures or live
an open error culture. Throughout the last years a trend in our industry as emerged to tackle
this differently - the blameless postmortem culture comes to mind - to finally bring change.
I want to share with the audience how we foster this culture with the various CSPs within the 
SCS project and want to encourage each listener to bring back some of this to their company.
