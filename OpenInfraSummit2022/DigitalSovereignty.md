# Digital sovereignty: Why open infrastructure matters

## Abstract

Hardly any other term has been redefined so frequently in public discussions during
recent years as “digital sovereignty”. Now in the mainstream, interpretations range
from using Open Source Software up to local franchise agreements with proprietary
cloud providers. This presentation demystifies the term “digital sovereignty” and
outlines why it’s not enough to be sovereign on a higher abstraction layer like
Kubernetes. Open infrastructure matters and is the key to independence, trust and
innovation. Together we will look at different criteria for digital sovereignty
and realize that some closed-source “sovereign” cloud stacks of may not bring as
much sovereignty as promised.
