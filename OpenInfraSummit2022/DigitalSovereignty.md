# Digital sovereignty: Why open infrastructure matters

## Abstract (1000 chars)

Hardly any other term has been redefined and reframed so frequently in public discussions
in recent years as “digital sovereignty”. Interpretations range from using Open Source Software
down to local franchise agreements with proprietary cloud providers applying the term
as a boilerplate.

This talk will demystify the term “digital sovereignty” and outline why it is
not just enough to be sovereign on a higher container layer or create local spin-offs 
from proprietary cloud service providers. Together we will look at different criteria
for digital sovereignty and realize that closed-source “sovereign” cloud
offerings may not bring as much sovereignty as promised.

Open infrastructure matters and is key to independence, trust and innovation.
In order to achieve true digital sovereignty, we need open source, operating knowledge
and vital open communities.

## What should attendees expect to learn? (1000 chars)

We will develop a well-defined taxonomy to better classify the various "sovereign"
cloud offerings. Participants will learn to confidently participate in public
discussions and how to demystify the frequently misused term digital sovereignty.
Together, we recap the key principles of the Four Freedoms and learn how they
create true digital sovereignty for government, industry, research, and society.
