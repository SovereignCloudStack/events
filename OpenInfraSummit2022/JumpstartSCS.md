## Abstract (1000 chars)

Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a network of existing and future providers of
standardized sovereign cloud infrastructure to join forces in defining, implementing
and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform. The underlying software
is developed in an open development process with open design discussions and
decisions by an open community. In doing so, our community stands like a tender
seedling on the shoulders of giants like the OIF, CNCF or Gaia-X communities.

This talk will give you an insight into the Sovereign Cloud Stack community,
how we're collaborating and especially how we provide our members a springboard
into great Open Source communities.

## Social Summary (100 chars)

Ever wondered how to climb the shoulders of giants? SCS is your springboard to
great communities!

## What should attendees expect to learn? (1000 chars)

Attendees will enjoy a guided tour through the Sovereign Cloud Stack community and
learn how to foster a healthy and engaged community based on the principles of the
Four Opens. A special focus will be on how to keep up with different upstream 
communities and how we offer our members a stepping stone to major projects.
