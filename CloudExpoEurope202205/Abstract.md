# Kurt Garloff: Using Sovereign Cloud Stack to Achieve Digital Sovereignty 

We have a decade behind us now, where we observe a recentralization of IT
infrastructure. This is driven by superior paradigms of using automation to
manage infrastructure, services and applications, which favors large platforms
that have driven this paradigm shift: cloud platforms. Europe, being late to
embracing innovative IT technology and having an economic structure that does
not favor large companies as much, does not have any players that have
significant market share in providing such platforms.

The risks are obvious â€” having hard to overcome dependencies on a small number
of large overseas providers creates legal challenges (GDPR, Schrems, Cloud
Act), strategic challenges, and disadvantageous economic power distribution.

There is a growing understanding in Europe that this trend needs to be reverted
and make progress with digital sovereignty.

Taking advantage of the existing open-source technologies by selecting,
integrating, testing, and operating them unfortunately requires a lot of
skills. It is currently mostly done by brave DevOps teams in providers mostly
in isolation from other providers.  Both we overcome with Sovereign Cloud Stack
by orchestrating the collaborative definition and implementation of the
platforms. We also ensure that operational topics (processes, automation) are
in focus, as this is where we have seen major companies fail.
