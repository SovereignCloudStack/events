## Objectives of the presentation
Attendees will be enabled to create, update and delete SCS compliant
standardized Kubernetes clusters on various cloud providers using ClusterAPI
based ClusterStacks. Furthermore awareness for the necessity for digital
sovereign infrastructure is raised.

## Description
### Summary
See how to create standardized Kubernetes-clusters to provide a digital
sovereign container layer using SCS ClusterStacks

### Detailed overview
The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is built upon the shoulders of giants: With
proven technology such as OpenStack and Kubernetes the SCS project is building
a modular software stack. SCS is much more than just another cloud stack - much
rather SCS defines standards as part of a community process in which CSPs work
together on their use-cases while also providing a reference implementation.

The reference implementation can provide the entire stack, but the technical
layers can also be used independently. One of these layers is the container
layer based on the Kubernetes Cluster API.

In order to use the Cluster API to install Kubernetes clusters on different
cloud providers, it is necessary to make further configurations depending on
the provider, as well as to provide the node images.

In our reference implementation of the container layer, we rely on
ClusterStacks to realize the management of SCS-standardized Kubernetes clusters
on different cloud providers. In this presentation, the speakers will address
how the concept of ClusterStacks came about, how they are deployed, and the
benefits they deliver in the operation of digital sovereign infrastructure.

The audience will then be able to create and manage complex and standardized
Kubernetes clusters.
