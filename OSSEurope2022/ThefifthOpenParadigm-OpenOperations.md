## Abstract (1300 characters)

Open Infrastructure technology has grown up. Nevertheless, high
quality management and operations of open platforms continues to
requires significant skills. The Sovereign Cloud Stack project has
been created with the goal to significantly lower the bar and with
the concept of collaboration over competition first results have
been achieved.

While the integration of a standardized operational stack helps the
platform operations teams, it is only an important first step.
The next step is to create strong communities that share operational
practices and make them openly available. Documenting best practices
and sharing tools is easy compared to being fully transparent.

Being transparent about bugs, incidents, security responses may sound
disturbing to traditional operation teams at first -- yet it is key
to build up experience and is the next step.

Only failures make us experts and embedding a healthy culture
towards errors has been proven to lead to less outages long term.
Furthermore it helps to create trust with users, especially when incidents
do occur.

With the 'Four Open' the community has been leading the way how open
source software is developed. Let's extend this by the adding the
'fifth paradigm': Open Operations.
