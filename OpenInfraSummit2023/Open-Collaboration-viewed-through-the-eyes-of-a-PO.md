Track: Open Development

Authors: Felix Kronlage-Dammers

Technical Level: Beginner

## Abstract (1000 chars)

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) orchestrates various standardization and development
efforts in an open and collobaritve fashion. The projects development efforts typically 
happen in the corresponding upstream project - done through funding and tender projects
just as much as through interested parties at the various cloud service providers that
utilize the SCS stack. Coordination happens in recurring meetings facilitated by the
product owners at the SCS project.
Since the beginning of 2022 the product owner for the IaaS reference implementation
(which is, obviously OpenStack) and OPS & IAM is part of the project. 
This talk will highlight how this development process works and will dive into all
the hurdles and problems one faces in this rather unique way of living the product
owner life.

## What should attendees expect to learn? (1000 chars)

Life as a Product Owner in a coherent team within one company is something different
than in a project where people from various companies, all with their own priorities,
jointly work together. I want to share my experience and mechanisms that I use to still
align everyone and move the project forward. Attendees can expect to take away ideas
on how to facilitate such meetings and also which ideas turned out for the worse ;)
