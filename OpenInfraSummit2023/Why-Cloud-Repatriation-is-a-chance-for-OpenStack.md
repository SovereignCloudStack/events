## Abstract (1000 chars)

Cloud Repatriation is a term that has been buzzing around the cloud industry since
the paper by a16z and has led to various claims that the age of cloud has its rise.
With efforts such as the Sovereign Cloud Stack Project more standardiziation of Cloud
offerings by Cloud Service Providers is anticipated. Such efforts are a big chance
for OpenStack since it allows that even in cases of Cloud Repatriation OpenStack will
still be the chosen workhorse, just not in a public but in a private cloud environment.
This talks wants to revisit the myths of cloud computing and what it really
has to offer aside from the always-promised easy scaling.
In the age of Infrastructure-as-Code standardized environments where the IaC
can be kept, even if the platform changes from public cloud to private environments,
a platform such as OpenStack, if it can be operated with confidence, offers lot's
of benefits.

Cloud Repatriation as a chance for more OpenStack adoption - let's move.

## What should attendees expect to learn? (1000 chars)

Even though various well-known people blog and tweet about how they left
the cloud it is not the end of cloud computing. Attendees will have
the chance to see how complex is this topic really is and why standardization
helps with further OpenStack adoption.
