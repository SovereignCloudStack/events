Track: Public Cloud (or private cloud?)

## Abstract (1000 chars)

Cloud Repatriation is a term that has been buzzing around the cloud industry since
the paper by a16z and has led to various claims that the age of cloud has its rise.
With efforts such as the Sovereign Cloud Stack Project more standardiziation of cloud
offerings by Cloud Service Providers is anticipated. Such efforts are a big chance
for OpenStack since it allows that even in cases of Cloud Repatriation OpenStack will
remain the chosen workhorse, just not in a public but in a private cloud environment.
This talks wants to revisit the myths of cloud computing and what it really
has to offer aside from the always-promised easy scaling.

As Infrastructure-as-Code is the de-facto way of deploying workloads standardized,
OpenStack can offer a lot of benefits â€“ especially if shifted from public cloud to
private environments. Backed by shared knowledge and thus fostering operational
confidence, the underlying platform can be kept and well-defined standards will assure
interoperability.

## Social Summary (100 chars)

Cloud Repatriation as a chance for more OpenStack adoption - let's move.

## What should attendees expect to learn? (1000 chars)

Even though various well-known people blog and tweet about how they left
the cloud, it is not the end of cloud computing. Attendees will have
the chance to see how complex this topic really is and why standardization
helps with further OpenStack adoption.
