## Abstract (1000 chars)

Cloud Repatriation is a term that has been buzzing around the cloud industry since
the paper by AZ21 and has led to various claims that the age of cloud has its rise.
With efforts such as the Sovereign Cloud Stack Project standardiziation of Cloud
is targeted. Such efforts are a big chance for OpenStack since it allows that
even in cases of Cloud Repatriation OpenStack will still be the workhorse, just
not in a public but in a private cloud environment.

This talks wants to revisit the myths of cloud computing and what it really
has to offer aside from the always-promised easy scaling.
