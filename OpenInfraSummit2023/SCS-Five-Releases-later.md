## Abstract (1000 chars)

The Sovereign Cloud Stack Project (SCS) started out in 2021 with the vision
to create one platform — standardized, built and operated by many. The SCS project
set out to create and nurture a set of standards and back this effort by providing
a reference implementation based on OpenStack. 
Since the project started there have been five releases, released twice a year in
March and September. In the spirit of public money - public code the project utilizes
money from a funding by the german ministry for economics and climate action to coordinate
and fund development in the various upstream projects.
This talk will give an overview of what has been achieved over the course of the last years,
will feature some insights into what has been easy and what was thougth to be easy but
turned out to be hard ;)
