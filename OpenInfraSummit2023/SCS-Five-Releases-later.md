## Abstract (1000 chars)

In 2021 a growing community of more than 20 contributing companies set out to 
create the Sovereign Cloud Stack Project (SCS) with the vision to create one
platform â€” standardized, built and operated by many. The SCS project was initiated
to create and nurture a set of standards and back this effort by providing
a reference implementation based on OpenStack. 
Since the project started there have been five releases, released twice a year in
March and September. In the spirit of Public Money - Public Code the project utilizes
money from a funding by the german Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action
to coordinate and fund development in the various upstream projects.
This talk will give an overview of what has been achieved over the course of the last years,
will feature some insights into what has been easy and what was thought to be easy but
turned out to be hard.
It will highlight how the project works upstream and how the corresponding results
enable Cloud Service Providers to deliver a better product to their customers and users.
