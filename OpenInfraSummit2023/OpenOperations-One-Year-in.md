# Open Operations - One Year in

Authors: Kurt Garloff, Felix Kronlage-Dammers

Track: TBD

Technical Level: Beginners

## Abstract

Open Source has changed the way software is being developed and used over the
last decades. The Open Infrastructure Community has been successful in evolving
and defining good practices for the collaborative development with the Four
Opens. The Open Operations movement is tackling a related problem: How can we
effectively establish collaboration in operating complex IT technology?
The authors have presented some ideas in the 2022 Berlin summit.

An Open Operations Manifesto has been written and is getting traction in the
community. The Operators in and around the Sovereign Cloud Stack project have
been working on establishing transparency, knowledge sharing and even
supporting each other as part of the Open Operation Initiative.

The authors will use examples to report on the progress, some of the challenges
and learnings and give an outlook on further expected developments.

## Social Summary

One year of experience with Open Operations.

## What should attendees expect to learn?

Attendees will learn how the emerging Open Operations community is translating
the ideas of Open Source from development to operations. After a good year,
first experience of what works in a straight-forward way and what does require
further thinking and refinement and possibly needs to be motivated differently
can be shared. Attendees should leave with ideas how to establish Open
Operations principles in their own context and ideally join in the bigger
movement to further establish and refine the Open Operations practices.
