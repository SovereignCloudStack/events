# Demystifying Digital Sovereignty
Kurt Garloff

Track: Open Development
Level: Beginner

## Abstract

Digital Sovereignty has become an important term when discussions happen on IT
strategy -- be it in the political or in business environments. This has been
driving numerous discussions, at least in Europe and the presenter has been
participating in some of them, e.g. by the involvement in the Gaia-X and the
Sovereign Cloud Stack initiatives.

The term is not well-defined which makes it prone to being shaped by commercial
players to be favorable for their own positioning. Some parties for example
argue that national hyperscalers need to be built and be favored by legislation
from governments. Others see private clouds as the silver bullet. Obviously,
Open Source technology or better technology governed by the Four Opens is an
important topic here as well. 

The presenter will discuss some angles that have been taken in using the term
and also demystify some of them. He will offer a systematic approach to
classify reasonable angles and contribute to bring some structure to the
debate.
