# Foster the Open Operations concept

Track: Community (or 'Open Source'?)

Authors: Felix Kronlage-Dammers

## Abstract (250 words)

Open Infrastructure technology has become increasingly mature. Nevertheless,
high quality management and operations of open platforms continues to require
DevOps teams with significant skills. The Sovereign Cloud Stack project has
been created with the goal to significantly lower the bar and with the
concept of collaboration over competition first results have been achieved
on the conceptual as well as technical side of things.

While the integration of a standardized operational stack helps the
platform operations teams, it is only an important first step.

The next step is to create strong communities that share operational practices
and make them openly available. Documenting best practices, fostering an open 
root cause analysis process just as much as publishing the little
tools to do cleanup jobs or the setup of dashboards that can be used for capacity
management are important contributions.

Being transparent about bugs, incidents, security responses may sound disturbing
to traditional operation teams at first -- yet it is key to build up experience. 
Only failures make us experts and embedding a healthy culture towards errors has
been proven to lead to less outages long term. Furthermore it helps to create
trust with users, especially when incidents do occur.

This is the core of the Open Operations concept.
