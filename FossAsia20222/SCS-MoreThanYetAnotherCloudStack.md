# Sovereign Cloud Stack - more than yet another cloud stack

## Abstract

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is built upon the shoulders of giants: With proven technology such
as OpenStack and Kubernetes the SCS project is building a modular software stack. SCS is much more
than just another cloud stack - much rather SCS defines standards as part of a community process in
which CSPs work together on their use-cases while also providing a reference implementation.
The talk will give an overview of the architecture of the Sovereign Cloud Stack.
